# Music Visualization with Processing

These projects utilize Processing and contributed libraries Minim and ControlP5.
These are a first effort to create music visualizations with processing.  Both
programs will listen to the lineIn on your machine.  As a default, it will
listen to the microphone.  An additional mixer tool may be needed to route the
audio output to your audio input so that the program listens to the audio
output.  On Mac, I utilized a tool, soundflowerbed.  The visualizer can now
listen to any audio output source across your favorite music provider.
